This is the example on how to use the [@grucloud/module-aws-certificate](../README.md).

Workflow for the certificate and the associated Route53 resources to validate it:

- Install the dependencies: `npm install`
- Edit **config.js** and set the relevant variables.
- Deploy with `gc apply`
- List with `gc list`
- Destroy with `gc destroy`
